# Why

## 2025-07-22

The main reason to make this game is that there's value in pushing along this overall project of remaking the same game over and over again from different angles.

This specific version is worth making as an exploration of extreme *minimalism* and the attendant challenges of making something *legible*.

I'm curious about: 

- whether the game remains understandable at all, 
- the degree to which it functions more as a reference to the original game versus conveying the myths on its own merits
- the ways that minimalism may foreground other design elements such as colour, animation, sound, instructions
