## Getting started (2025-07-22)

Made the repo for this project today as it feels like I may just want to "quickly" make the game and move on from it? I'm seeing it as at least in part a chance to very quickly reintegrate p5 into my brain for my upcoming teaching in September.

But really it's such a simple idea there's maybe not going to be a million things to say? Though as in the sketches above, there will be some stuff around UI design and particularly the use of colour/alpha to communicate ideas.

I guess there's also going to be something in this about its referentiality to the previous games as well... the sense in which it's about recognition of a different game at extremely low resolution? I feel like that's such an internet/meme thing, the smallest recognizable resolution of the Girl with a Pearl Earring or whatever?

Anyway, getting started.
